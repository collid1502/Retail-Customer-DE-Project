# Analytics Database

Here, we will use a Postgres image to create an analytical database that can store the results of our Spark ETL and create a data model that can be used for queries & reporting

We set some generic info for thsi project as it's development & testing only:

- Database Name : `retail_analytics`
- Postgres User : `admin_postgres`
- Postgres Password : `postgres_password` 

These details can be used to connect to the Postgres instance
