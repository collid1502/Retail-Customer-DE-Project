# Local Development

This sub-directory will contain pipeline code and segments developed locally, before they move to AWS for the actual running of the pipeline.

## Sections

### Docker

Inside the Docker folder, there will be different sub-sections where I explore using docker to develop on different services (locally) and explore how docker can be used to ship code / applications around more easily.


### Devcontainer

This is for VS Code to interact with Docker containers, and let you build and operate within a docker container through the VS code editor. More details within sub-directory.
